# Climate, Environment & Sustainable Cities



Personal explorations into climate change data, environmental trends, and sustainable urban development using open datasets and Python notebooks.



## Why this repo?

- Passionate about using data to understand and address global challenges like climate resilience, urban heat, green spaces, and low-carbon cities.

- Builds on my data analysis skills (EDA, anomaly detection, visualization) from other projects.

- Focus: Reproducible analysis with public datasets — no proprietary tools.



## Current Notebooks / Content

- `climate_trends_exploration.ipynb` → Basic analysis of global temperature, CO₂ emissions, extreme weather (work in progress).

- More coming soon: Urban heat islands, sustainable city indicators, green space mapping, renewable energy transitions.



## Key Open Datasets Used / Planned

- NASA / NOAA global temperature & CO₂ (GISS, NOAA NCEI)

- World Bank Urban Indicators (population density, green space, emissions)

- UN-Habitat City Prosperity Index / Urban Data

- Copernicus / ESA satellite data for land use & urban expansion

- Kaggle / Our World in Data collections on climate & sustainability



## Setup (Colab/Local)

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

jupyter notebook

```

Or run notebooks directly in Google Colab (badges added per notebook)


## Skills Demonstrated

Python · Pandas · Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly · Geospatial basics (GeoPandas if added) · Data Visualization · Time-Series Analysis

Inspired by open-source sustainability projects like Open Sustainable Technology (https://opensustain.tech/) and World Bank urban datasets.
