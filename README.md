# Climate, Environment & Sustainable Cities



Personal explorations into climate change data, environmental trends, and sustainable urban development using open datasets and Python notebooks.



## Why this repo?

- Passionate about using data to understand and address global challenges like climate resilience, urban heat, green spaces, and low-carbon cities.

- Builds on my data analysis skills (EDA, anomaly detection, visualization) from other projects.

- Focus: Reproducible analysis with public datasets — no proprietary tools.



## Current Notebooks / Content

- [`climate_trends_exploration.ipynb`](https://github.com/S33mi/climate-urban-sustainability/blob/main/notebooks/climate_trends_exploration.ipynb) → Basic analysis of global temperature, CO₂ emissions, extreme weather (work in progress).
- [`climate_trends_exploration.ipynb`](https://github.com/S33mi/climate-urban-sustainability/blob/main/notebooks/climate_trends_exploration.ipynb) → ([![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/S33mi/climate-sustainable-cities/blob/main/notebooks/climate_trends_exploration.ipynb)).

- More coming soon: Urban heat islands, sustainable city indicators, green space mapping, renewable energy transitions.



## Key Open Datasets Used / Planned

- NASA / NOAA global temperature & CO₂ (GISS, NOAA NCEI)

- World Bank Urban Indicators (population density, green space, emissions)

- UN-Habitat City Prosperity Index / Urban Data

- Copernicus / ESA satellite data for land use & urban expansion

- Kaggle / Our World in Data collections on climate & sustainability



## Setup (Colab/Local)

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

jupyter notebook

```

Or run notebooks directly in Google Colab ([![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/S33mi/climate-sustainable-cities/blob/main/notebooks/notebooks/climate_trends_exploration.ipynb))

## Dataset sources (download/upload to Colab or use direct links where possible):

Temperature: NASA GISS (https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/)

CO₂: NOAA (https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/data.html)

Urban/sustainable cities: World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/topic/urban-development), UN-Habitat (https://data.unhabitat.org/), or Kaggle "Sustainable Urban Planning" dataset.


## Skills Demonstrated

Python · Pandas · Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly · Geospatial basics (GeoPandas if added) · Data Visualization · Time-Series Analysis

Inspired by open-source sustainability projects like Open Sustainable Technology (https://opensustain.tech/) and World Bank urban datasets.
